# Spring Petclinic Migration - Project Summary

This file consolidates all key information from the following documentation files:
- README_CONSOLIDATED.md
- INDEX.md
- technical_architecture.md
- implementation_plan.md
- task.md
- COMPLIANCE.md
- enhanced_plan_summary.md
- recommendations_and_questions.md

## 1. Overview
- Modernized from Spring 4/Java 8/MySQL/HSQLDB/Bootstrap 2 to Spring 6.2.1/Java 21/PostgreSQL 16/Bootstrap 5.
- Focus on observability, resilience, security, and compliance.

## 2. Technology Stack
- Java 21, Spring 6.2.1, Hibernate 6.6.4, PostgreSQL 16, Bootstrap 5, Caffeine, HikariCP, Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, Resilience4J, JUnit 5, Mockito, Maven, WildFly 30+.

## 3. Architecture
- Layered: Web (Spring MVC + JSP/Bootstrap 5), Service (business logic, AOP aspects), Repository (Spring Data JPA), Data (PostgreSQL, Caffeine).
- Java-based configuration: AppConfig imports DataSourceConfig, JpaConfig, WebMvcConfig, CacheConfig, SecurityConfig, ObservabilityConfig, ResilienceConfig.

## 4. Key Features
- Owner, Pet, Visit, Vet management.
- Audit logging (AOP aspect, audit_log table, 7-year retention).
- PII data masking in logs.
- Security headers, input sanitization.
- Observability: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, MDC trace/span IDs in logs.
- Resilience: Circuit breaker, rate limiter, bulkhead, retry policy.
- Performance: HikariCP, Caffeine, optimized queries, indexes.
- Bootstrap 5 UI: Responsive, modern, accessible.

## 5. Migration & Planning
- All legacy repository implementations removed; only Spring Data JPA used.
- Database scripts and schema fully migrated to PostgreSQL.
- Implementation plan: 17 phases, from analysis to deployment.
- Task breakdown: granular steps for each migration phase.
- Enhanced plan: partitioning, audit log, code quality, observability.
- Recommendations: selective reactive patterns, UI modernization paths.

## 6. Compliance & Security
- GDPR: Data minimization, right to erasure, audit trail, PII masking.
- PCI DSS: Not applicable (no payment data).
- Audit logs: CRUD operations tracked, partitioned by month, retained 7 years.
- Security: InputSanitizer, DataMaskingUtil, security headers, session config.


## 7. Observability, Health Endpoints & Deployment
- Prometheus endpoint, Grafana dashboards, custom metrics, trace/span ID propagation.
- WildFly deployment: JNDI datasource, security subsystem, performance tuning.
- Logging: logback.xml with petclinic.log, metrics.log, traces.log (daily rotation, 30-day retention).

## 10. Configuration Externalization
All major configuration (database, cache, JPA, resilience, observability, etc.) is externalized in `src/main/resources/application.properties`. No sensitive or environment-specific values are hardcoded in Java code. See the properties file for details.

## 8. Project Status & Quality
- All requirements satisfied: PostgreSQL only, Bootstrap 5, servlet config, Spring Data JPA, CrashController, logs/metrics/traces, documentation consolidation.
- 95%+ test coverage, Spotless formatting, comprehensive Javadoc.
- Documentation index and master file created for easy navigation.

## 9. Quick Links
- For details, see: ERD.md, LLD.md, HLD.md, MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md, OBSERVABILITY_GUIDE.md, WILDFLY_DEPLOYMENT.md.
